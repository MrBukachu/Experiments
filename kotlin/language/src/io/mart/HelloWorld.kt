/*
* Diffs:
* - no semicolons
* - wide usage of wrappers (e.g. println = System.out.println)
* - hard keywords (as in java), soft keywords
* - own String class
* - K does not distinguish between checked and unchecked exceptions
* - no static keyword (but concept is here)
* - referential equality (===), structural equality (==)
* - bit operators (x | y now is x or y, x & y now is x and y)
* - casting: object as Employee, and also there is smart casting
