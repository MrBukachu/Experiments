DATA MODEL:
 keyspace
 column families (like tables in relational model)
 keys
 columns

HOW IT IS STORED:
memtable (memory)
    Cassandra does not repeat names of columns
    Stores writes until reaching a limit => Flushes data to SSTable

SSTable (Disk)
    Cassandra does not repeat names of columns
    Immutable
    compaction: new SSTable instead of multiple old

Commit log (Disk)
    GOAL: for recovering data in memtable if hardware fails
    Writes history is recorded here
    Data is purged after its corresponding data in memtable is flushed to SSTable

* If row is not in memtable, read of row needs look-up in all SSTable files =>
read is slower than write

INDEX:
Access data  using non-private key fields other than the partition key.
If there is no index on normal column, it is not allowed to
conditionally query by the column.


REPLICATION:
Consistent hashing mechanism is used to distribute data across cluster.
Each cluster has a partitioner configured for hashing each partition key.
     Each row of data is uniquely identified by a partition key and distributed
     across the cluster by the value of token.
Cass stores replicas on multiple nodes to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.
Replication factor:
    1:
