Adapter is a structural design pattern, which allows incompatible objects to collaborate.

Identification: Adapter is recognizable by a constructor which takes an instance of different abstract/interface type. When adapter receives a call to any of its methods, it translates parameters to appropriate format and then directs the call to one or several methods of the wrapped object.
